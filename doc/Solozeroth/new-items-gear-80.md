#### Solozeroth New Items
This is a list of gear that I have added and where the player will encounter them.

#### Dial-A-Mage
- Level 80 Trinket
- sql/custom/world/2017_04_29_00_world.sql
- src/server/scripts/Custom/solo_helper.cpp
- Costs 75 Badges of Valor
- Sold by Debbi Moore in Dalaran
- 101 Crit, Hit, Stamina, Health per 5.
- Summons non-combat Wizard who has services.
- Services: Teleport to Dalaran, Summon Mail Device, Hire NPC combat helpers.
- Two types of helpers, Normal (7g), Elite (20g).
- Can hire unlimited number of helpers.
- Helper "Class" is combo of Paladin/Shaman/Warroir that will try to hold threat, self heal/mana-regen alright, and be fun to play with.
- AI for helpers is basic, with simple follow player, attack bad things in range, and weighted randomized ability use. 
- When combined with the (very minor) server mod to allow loot credit by only "tapping" the mob, one can play a healer and still be rewarded when doing the Icecrown dailies, etc.
