#### Solozeroth Outland Gear Adjustments
When playing solo, all the level 70 gear is pointless, because it will get replaced by quest greens in Northrend. However, there are often times when leveling through Outland where your character could use some gear upgrades, epsecially right at level 60 for many classes. These changes allow the player to buy gear from various vendors at levels when the gear would still be useful.
