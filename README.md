## Solozeroth
A set of customizations for TrinityCore (3.3.5), which is an *MMORPG* Framework based mostly in C++. For further information on the TrinityCore project, please visit [TrinityCore.org](https://www.trinitycore.org).

## Project Scope
This is a personal hobby that I am working on in my spare time (and sharing here), because I feel like it. The single objective of this project is to make using TrinityCore more enjoyable for myself personally. 

## Documentation
See [doc/Solozeroth/README.md](doc/Solozeroth/README.md) for detailed information about each customization.
